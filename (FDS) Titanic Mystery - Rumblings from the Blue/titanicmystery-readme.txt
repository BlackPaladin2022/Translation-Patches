Titanic Mystery: Ao no Senritsu

Originally, "Titanic Mystery" was a computer game from the Commodore 64.  When it was ported to the Famicom Disk System, it was changed dramatically.  There are also four endings, depending on the player's actions.

The object of the game is to keep making money by picking up items from the Titanic to sell to fund further expeditions all while finding a way to raise the Titanic from the ocean depths.  You have a choice of three different divers though there are no visible differences among the three and each characters' sprites are identical, Momo (Mokoko) Rei (Reika), and Mary (Marin).
