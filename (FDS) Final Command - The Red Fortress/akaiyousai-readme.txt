Final Command: The Red Fortress is a overhead run-and-gun action game for the Famicom Disk System.  For those unaware, this game released in the United States as the NES game "Jackal".  The FDS version does lack some aspects that the US-released NES game contains.

1.  The stages scroll only vertically.
2.  State layout is different to the US-Released version to account for the stages scrolling vertically only.
3.  Checkpoint Alpha is not in the FDS version of the game.
4.  Checkpoint Baker is the game's introductory stage.
5.  Checkpoint Zulu has not hostages to rescue.

The patch comes in two flavors...
Final Command - The Red Fortress (English).ips
--English Translation Patch (IPS Format)
Final Command - The Red Fortress (English).bps
--English Translation Patch (BPS Format)

Use either the IPS or BPS patch on the FDS ROM with the followings hashes.  (Don't use both patches.)

File/ROM SHA-1: C8A2EE105571D0DCC3099F9A96DB93F41B31BF5A

If you use either the IPS or BPS patch, the end result is a translated FDS ROM with the following hashes...
