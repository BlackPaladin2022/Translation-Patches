Mashou is an action RPG, released by Irem in 1986.  You play the role of Prince Myer who must face against Rubas to protect his kingdom.

Rubas plan to ring seven bells to summons demons take over the kingdom of Willner.  Prior to his Prince Myer's coronation, he receives a message from a mysterious being, telling him that he must go to Rubas' castle in the northern mountains and burn down the seven bell towers and vanquish Rubas once and for all.

This game was released released in the United States under the name, "Deadly Towers".  This patch was made almost entirely out of boredom and curiosity.

Note:  Unless I say otherwise, I do not want this patch to be posted on RHDN without my expressed permission.

--English translation patch for the USA ROM (IPS Patch)
Hell's Bells B (English).bps

If you're using the Japanese ROM for patching, you'll need the ROM with the following hashes for either IPS or BPS "Hell's Bells (English)" patch.  (Don't use both patches.)

If you're using the USA Deadly Towers ROM for patching, you'll need the ROM with the following hashes for either IPS or BPS "Hell's Bells B (English)" patch.  (Again, don't use both patches.)
