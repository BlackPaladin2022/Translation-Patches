Jikai Shounen Metmag is a puzzle game, developed by Thinking Rabbit and published by Square (now Square Enix), as part of the "Disk Original Group".  In this game, you have to clear 100 levels to reach the game's ending.  This involves working around magnetic fields.  Depending on your color, you can jump higher or lower than normal and attract or repel certain colored blocks in later stages.

Note:  At the title screen, press the up or down arrows to select to play as a boy or girl.  As a boy, the game displays the title screen "Magnetic Boy Metmag", and you start off blue.  As a girl, the game displays the title screen "Magnetic Girl Matmeg", and you start off red.
