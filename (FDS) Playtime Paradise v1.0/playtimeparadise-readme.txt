******************************

I decided to work on this game's translation patch on a break from other projects that needed my attention.  Almost all of the hacking to get the translation taken care of was done through graphics editing.

As for what "Playtime Paradise" is, it's a collection of party games, released by SOFEL.  The name of this title literally means, "Playtime Paradise: Game Heaven", I decided to shorten it to just "Playtime Paradise" for the patch.

As for what's in this game, these are the party games that can be found in "Playtime Paradise"

Village Bingo:  This is generally a bingo caller.  You're a cat with a mallet.  The chicken's you see walking across the screen is what you need to hit with your mallet.  When you do, it'll lay an egg (Press the A Button) with a number.  A snake will devour the egg and walk away.

Forest Roulette:  Up to five players can play this game.  You decide on a color, an animal, and a number, and how much points you want to bet. (Press the A button to select your options.)  You place your bet and spin.

This game has untranslated text.  When it comes to selecting colors, you decided on either "あか" (red) or "あお" (blue).

Set Dice:  You choose how many dice to be rolled.  Five NPCs will throw dice.  Press the A button to throw the dice.  Press the B button for the NPCs to pick up and carry the thrown dice off screen.  New NPCs will appear to throw more dice.  You simply use this for board games that use dice.

Family Slottle Machine:  Up to five players can play this game.  This game is just a glorified slot machine.  Why this is called "Slottle", it's a combination of "Slots" and "Throttle".
  
Barely Blackjack:  This game requires two to five players, one of which will have a "D" marker on it for "dealer".  The dealer is chosen at random.  Each player bets their points in a simple game of blackjack.  Using playing cards, you simply have to have the highest number against other players without going over twenty-one.
 
Continuous Poker:  This game also requires two to five players.  You simply bet points in a game of poker.  You have to have the best hand among all players to win.  With the D-Pad, you select which cards you want to keep or flip face down to change.  (Once you flip a card face down, you can't change your mind later.)  After all players made their decisions on their hands, use the D-Pad to select "GAME" at the bottom of the screen.  The player with the best hands wins.

Surely Neurosis:  This game can be played from one player to five players.  It's a game of memory.  You flip two cards, and if both cards are the same number, you score points.
 
Even More Speed:  This game requires two players.  Each player has four cards in front of them, and two other cards.  Players take turns with playing cards as fast as they can to create matching sets.  The card you must play has to be one above or below the card that's currently out in play between players.

*Known Issues*

In the game "Forest Roulette", the color selection of red (あか) and blue (あお) are left untranslated.  I haven't figured out how to change the tiles used in that selection to read in English yet.
