-Ultraman 2: Shutsugeki Katoku Tai-
-----------------------------------

Ultraman 2: Sally Forth, Science Patrol is the sequel to the first Ultraman console video game, "Ultraman: Kaiju Teikoku no Gyakushuu".  Unlike the first Ultraman FDS game, Ultraman 2 has less focus on Ultraman himself and more focus on the special team that assists him against kaiju... the aforementioned "Katoku Tai".

Note:  While "Katoku Tai" literally means "Special Forces", the team focused on this game is the "Science Special Search Party" or S.S.S.P. for short.  For this patch, the English dub name "Science Patrol" was used.

This game is confusing to play, at first.  However, when you learn how to play the game, it's very easy though as the game progresses, you'll have to fight more than one kaiju at once.

1.  One member of the Science Patrol hops on the Patrol Car (P-Car) and search to a building on the map with a red dot.  (You cannot damage kaijus without it.)
2.  Enter the building and walk down a long corridor to get the item.  There will be a kaiju that will randomly teleport and you cannot damage this kaiju in any way.  After picking up the item, you leave the same way you enter.
3.  Back in Science Patrol Headquarters, select a team member in either Beetle-1, Beetle-2, or Beetle-3 and fire on the kaiju.  It's best to shoot one bullet at the kaiju.  If you hear the kaiju growl as its shot, you've inflicted damage onto the kaiju.
4.  Continue to fire at the kaiju until its health is depleted.  When that happens, the game will immediately inform you to "Flip to Side A".  Another option is to greatly weaken the kaiju and before you kill it off and fly near to the severely weakened kaiju.  Press the Start button and select "Call Ultraman".  Hayata will transform into Ultraman, and you can engage in a one-on-one battle with the kaiju where you can press the B button to fire the Ultrabeam (Specium Beam) until the kaiju is defeated.

Note:  On the tenth and final stage, the final boss cannot be damaged until you kill off the other two kaiju on the map first.

Only five characters from the Science Patrol is playable, four from the 1966 Ultraman TV show as well as yourself.  (Due to text space and display limitations, the Science Patrol members' names had to be truncated throughout most of the game.)
