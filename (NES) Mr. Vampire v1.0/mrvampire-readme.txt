*BlackPaladin's Mr. Vampire NES Translation Patch*

---------------
-Reigen Doushi-
---------------

Reigen Doushi is licensed action-fighting game for the NES.  In this game, you are Master Kau, and on your journey is your pupil, Man-Choi.  Across the Chinese countryside, you're travelling from one city to another, and your job is to defeat the rampaging kyonshi (Chinese hopping vampires, also known as "jianshi" which literally means "stiff corpse") that are attacking the villagers therein.

This game was released in the United States with its licensed stripped under the name "Phantom Fighter".  Supposedly, the reason behind this is that the film this game was based on (Mr. Vampire) wasn't that well known in the United States at the time.  This patch will restore the game to its original form.

Note: The game's title literally means "The Miracle Taoist". However, since this game is based on the Chinese film, it was decided that this translation patch coincides with the film of the same name.

Note II: This translation patch also has the player the opportunity to beat the game with the conshi (child kyonshi), but the game's ending with the conshi hasn't been tested yet.
