This is my personal repository of translation patches for various NES and FDS games I've made over the years.  Feel free to download and use them for your playing collection.

Frequently Asked Questions:

1.  Hey, I want to make a translation patch using your patch as a base.  Can I translate it to another language?

You don't need to ask!  Feel free to do that!  All I ask is give credit where it's due.  (Thank the original creators of said patches, etc.)

2.  I can't find the necessary file to use on your translation patches.  Can you send them to me?

Absolutely not!  You're going have to look for it yourself.  I cannot provide that for you.

3.  I think you did something wrong.  I think you should change something in whatever patch.

Feel free to contact me about it.  Heck, If you even want to make an addendum that works with my patch, you don't need to ask.  Feel free to do so!  (Again, give credit where it's due.)

4.  Hey, I wanted to ask if you can work on this game I was interested in.  Can you do it, please?

That depends on the game.  If it piques my interest, I might do it in the future.  Otherwise, I'm not making anything.

5.  Why do you work on only NES and FDS games?  Can't work on something else?  Like SuperNES/Gameboy/PSX, etc.?

The NES is one of two video game consoles that I have the strongest nostalgia for.  (The other is the Atari 2600.)  There are a lot of NES/FDS games that never received a translation for.  However, I am not opposed to the idea working on other consoles' games.  If it interests me, I might do it.  If it doesn't, not happening.

6.  Dude, your patches suck!  Do something better!

You're entitled to your opinion.  If you can work better than me, feel free to do so.  Otherwise, back off!
