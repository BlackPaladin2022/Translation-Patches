Apple Town Monogatari: Little Computer People is a simulation game for the Famicom Disk System.  It was developed and produced by Square as part of the "Disk Original Group" line.

Originally, this was a PC game for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad SPC, Atari ST, and the Apple II, and it was released by Activision.  When it was brought to Japan, it was released for the Famicom Disk System (Released by Square, now Square Enix, as part of the "Disk Original Group") and the PC-88.

Note:  When you start your game, the girl's name is chosen at random from up to sixty-three different names.  However, you must have your emulator's RAM initialization to set to use random values.  Otherwise, the girl's name will always be shown as "Kathy".  The following emulators have been tested to make the girl's name random when starting the game up.  (If you want a different name for the girl, delete the old save file in your emulators' location of save files and relaunch the game.)

The following settings must be set in the following emulators in order to randomize the girl's name when starting the game.  (No other emulator has been tested.)
