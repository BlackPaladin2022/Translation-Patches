-BlackPaladin's Bloody Warriors Addendum Patch-

***************************************
*Bloody Warriors: Shan-Go Strikes Back*
***************************************

First things first, I want to thank ded302 and snark for working this game's translation patch in the first place.  They did a good job in making this game enjoyable for the English speaking masses.  However, I remember back in August 2021 that I wanted to alert them of several strings of untranslated text that still remained in the game.  At the time, I heard nothing.  I even contacted Dodgy Translations, but all attempts at contacting that group was fruitless.  Thus, I decided to fix this game myself.

I had constructed two tables (one for the ded302/snark patched game and one for the original Japanese game) and got to work.  While I did use DeepL, 10ten, and Google Translate (please don't hold that against me) to fill in the gaps, I did the best I could do at the time and released an addendum patch during that time.

However, I had thought of that there might have been something else I might have missed.  After picking up my notes which I had in storage and dusting them off, I looked at the game, and I was shocked to what I had seen.  There were still A LOT more stuff that went untouched or removed from the game. (Which I can only assume was by ded302 and/or snark)  After learning all that I had done in the many months thereafter, I decided to use Atlas and Cartographer to dump and insert any text that was either left untouched or were outright removed.  Thus, the addendum translation patch is now a more completed project.

Patching Instructions:

This addendum patch come in four flavors:


Bloody Warriors - Shan-Go Strikes Back (English 2.0).ips
--This patch requires a clean and unaltered ROM (IPS format)
Bloody Warriors - Shan-Go Strikes Back (English 2.0).bps
--This patch requires a clean and unaltered ROM (BPS format)
Bloody Warriors - Shan-Go Strikes Back B (English 2.0).ips
--This patch requires a pre-patched ROM that already has ded302/snark's patch already applied (IPS Format)
Bloody Warriors - Shan-Go Strikes Back B (English 2.0).bps
--This patch requires a pre-patched ROM that already has ded302/snark's patch already applied (BPS Format)


I recommend using Lunar IPS for applying the IPS patches.  Flips can be used to apply the IPS or BPS patches. (Don't use both patches.)

The patches require the original ROM with the following hashes.

File SHA-1: 186B86C0004E43E707F00248DCE1A9A2F9818702
File CRC32: 76823B90
ROM SHA-1: AE64B6FBCC992EF8A2B3A6B7D80AD598B168E39D
ROM CRC32: 391AA1B8

The "B" patches require the ROM with ded302/snark's translation applied with the following hashes. (Don't use both patches.)

File SHA-1: D9681E6E0E509752E618EDF2606A88329FEFC57E
File CRC32: E283D06D
ROM SHA-1: 922BB74CC1B49CDCB9DCDA42C70CD9C1F00A423A
ROM CRC32: AD1B4A45

If you've applied the translation patch to either original ROM or on a ROM with ded302/snark's translation patch applied (v1.01), you should receive the ROM with the following hashes.

File SHA-1: 7EF3E18854021DD307E71B34021A8F0C216F5647
File CRC32: C81C34D1
ROM SHA-1: 21FD636558783142B621AC2752E98C409793B74B
ROM CRC32: ADB3F206
