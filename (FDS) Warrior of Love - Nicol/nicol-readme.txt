*Ai Senshi Nicol*

This is a small project I wanted to tackle out of boredom.  Thinking this was a simple title screen translation, I wanted to work on this game.  However, it wasn't simple as this game uses the infamous Konami RLE compression algorithm... just like Dracula II.  Also, the hex values that comprised the tile screen graphics also uses RLE Compression as well... again, like Dracula II.

Fortunately, the tools I had used for my infamous Dracula II project also worked on the compressed graphics in Ai Senshi Nicol, so while I had to cross several more hurdles to get this translation project off the ground, I knew what to expect.

The patch comes in two flavors...

Warrior of Love - Nicol (English).ips
--English Translation patch (IPS Format)
Warrior of Love - Nicol (English).bps
--English Translation patch (BPS Format)

The patch requires the ROM with the following hashes...

Use either the IPS or the BPS patch to get the ROM with the following hashes.  (Don't use both patches.)
