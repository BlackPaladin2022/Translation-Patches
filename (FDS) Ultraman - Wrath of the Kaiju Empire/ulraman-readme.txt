***************************************

This patch was made out of boredom and a budding curiosity with the Ultraman franchise.  The only editing done on this game was the title screen.  That's it, really.

Ultraman is a classic tokusatsu series that started in 1966 by Tsuburaya Productions, which is still going strong even in the present day.  
Ultraman: Kaijuu Teikoku no Gyakushuu is the second Ultraman video game released and the first game released for the Famicom Disk System.  (The first Ultraman video game was released for the MSX.)
