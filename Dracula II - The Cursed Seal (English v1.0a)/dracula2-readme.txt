*Dracula II: Noroi no Fuuin*
****************************

Dracula 2: The Cursed Seal is an action RPG, released by Konami, set seven years after the events of the previous game, "Akumajou Dracula" (Castlevania).

Simon Belmondo slew Dracula seven years prior, but he recently learned that after he dispatched the Prince of Darkness, a curse was placed upon him which will weaken him and claim his life.  To undo this curse, Simon must find five of Dracula's body parts inside five mansions, bring them back to Dracula's castle to burn them, and revive Dracula again so that he could slay the vampire and remove the curse.

For those unaware, this game was released in the United States and Europe as "Castlevania II: Simon's Quest".

As for what differs between the FDS version and the localized NES versions of the game, they are as follows...

1.  Dracula II has a much different sound, due to the extra sound channels from the Famicom Disk System.
2.  Instead of using a password, you can save your progress in the game.
3.  The ending credits will display after earning one of the three endings of the game.
