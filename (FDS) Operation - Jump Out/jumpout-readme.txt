This was another project I picked up out of boredom.  It's a simple translation patch for the Famicom Disk System game "Tobidase Daisakusen" (Translated as "Operation: Jump Out).  This game was released in the United States for the Nintendo Entertainment System under the name, "The Battles of 3-D Worldrunner".

This game does have a 3-D mode.  Press the select button while playing, and that will activate anaglyphic 3-D mode.  (You'll need 3-D glasses... glasses where one lens is red and the other is blue... to be able to see the 3-D effects.)

The patch comes in two flavors...

Operation - Jump Out (English).ips
English translation patch (IPS Format)
Operation - Jump Out (English).bps
English translation patch (BPS Format)

I recommend using Lunar IPS for applying the IPS patches.  Flips can be used to apply the IPS or BPS patches. (Don't use both patches.)

The patches require the original ROM with the following hashes.

File/ROM SHA-1: 26CD51C5598677734BB936E82114564D9A7269E7
File/ROM CRC32: CAA25A7F

If you've applied the translation patch to the unedited ROM, you should receive the ROM with the following hashes.

File/ROM SHA-1: 69F589871945156735A4F1746C38D69912C652F6
File/ROM CRC32: 938AB0AF
