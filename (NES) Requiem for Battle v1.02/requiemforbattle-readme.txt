******************
*Tatakai no Banka*
******************

I was bored one night while waiting for some other projects, so I came up with this quick patch.  This translate the Japanese game "Tatakai no Banka" (Requiem for Battle) in English.  For those in the English-speaking regions, this game was releaed as "Trojan".

Patching Instructions:

This translation patch comes in six flavors:

Requiem for Battle (English).ips
--This patch requires a clean and unaltered Tataki no Banka ROM (IPS format)
Requiem for Battle (English).bps
--This patch requires a clean and unaltered Tataki no Banka ROM (BPS format)

Requiem for Battle B (English).ips
--This patch requires a clean and unaltered Trojan (USA) ROM (IPS format)
Requiem for Battle B (English).bps
--This patch requires a clean and unaltered Trojan (USA) ROM (BPS format)

Requiem for Battle C (English).ips
--This patch requires a clean and unaltered Trojan (Europe) ROM (IPS format)
Requiem for Battle C (English).bps
--This patch requires a clean and unaltered Trojan (Europe) ROM (BPS format)

I recommend using Lunar IPS for IPS patches.  Flips can be used to apply IPS or BPS patches.

To apply whichever patch, use either the IPS or BPS patch (not both) on the following ROMs...
