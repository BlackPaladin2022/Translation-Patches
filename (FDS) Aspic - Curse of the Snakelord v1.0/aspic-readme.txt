-BlackPaladin's "Aspic: Curse of the Snakelord" FDS Translation Patch-

**************************
*Aspic: Mahebiou no Noroi*
**************************

For those who are unfamiliar with this game, this is a sequel to an older RPG title, titled "Lizard".  This game continues where that game ends.  

While the hero, Samsom, is searching for the Book of Truth, a wizard from Suna (Sand World) makes a proclamation to the king.  This wizard can uncurse his daughter, the princess.  However, she needs to come with the wizard to Suna.  The king sends 10 soldiers with the wizard and the princess so that she could be uncursed.  The curse was lifted, but instead of returning the princess, she's to be a bride to Aspic the Snakelord.  The ten soldiers, except for one, were slain either by Aspic himself or by Suna's intense heat.  The lone survivor returns to the castle to relay the news, Samson being there to hear everything.  With the Book of Truth in hand, Samson embarks on another quest.  This time, it's to slay Aspic the Snakelord and return the princess to the king.  If only Samson knew what Aspic has in store...

One thing to point out is that when switching disc sides when prompted, it doesn't immediately start loading the game.  You'll have to eject and reinsert it (possibly more than once) for the game to start loading.  This issue exists in the original hardware as well.

Because of tight space limitations, some names had to be changed.  For example, the name of worlds mentioned in-game....

Hito (Human World)
Umi (Sea World)
Suna (Sand World)
Makai (Demon World)

In the enemy battle GUI, Samson's name is shortened to "SAM" and warrior companions are listed as "WARR" because there's only room for up to four letters per character listed in-game.  Also, any skeletons appearing in-game are simply called "BONE".

Some item names were given similar treatment.  The game only allowed up to eight characters per item.  (The overworld screen's dialogue box is eight character wide.)
