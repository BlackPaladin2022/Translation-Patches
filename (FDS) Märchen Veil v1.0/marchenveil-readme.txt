-BlackPaladin's Märchen Veil Translation Patch-

*Märchen Veil*
**************

Märchen Veil is an action RPG developed by System Sacom and published by Sunsoft.  While the first Märchen Veil was ported to several computers and consoles at the time (Famicom Disk System, PC-88, FM-7, MSX, PC-98), the game's sequel (Märchen Veil II) was only released for the PC-98.  This translation patch is to be used on the Famicom Disk System port of the game.

The word, "Märchen" is a loan word from German.  It means "Fairytale".

The story is about a prince who was flung far away and from his homeland of Felix by an evil wizard and rendered unconsious before he could marry his bride.  When the prince awoke, he discovered that he had been transformed into a veil.  (A "veil" resembles a satyr from Green Mythology.)  The prince must travel the wasteland to find a way to return to his home land of Felix and restore his human form.
