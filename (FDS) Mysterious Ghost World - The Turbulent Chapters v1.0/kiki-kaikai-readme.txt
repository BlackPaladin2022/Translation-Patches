************************

Kiki Kaikai: Dotou Hen is an adaptation of the arcade game for the Famicom Disk System. Unlike its arcade counterpart or its ports on the MSX or PC-Engine, many changes were made on the Famicom Disk System port to make it different to the arcade.

1.  A Day/Night cycle added
2.  Charms (Ofudas) are used as both throwing weapons and as currency
3.  The game takes places on a non-linear overworld map
4.  Many bosses' locations were rearranged, and new bosses were added
5.  A second player can be participate in the game, albeit playing alternatively.
6.  A timer added in the game for the player to play the game before it reaches the end. (The game starts on January 8. The game ends when the timer reaches to December 31.)

You play the role of Sayo-chan (Miki-chan is Player 2).  One day, Sayo-chan received a message from the seven gods of fortune of impending doom. Some time later, wicked youkai imprisoned these seven gods to bring misfortune and strife to the people of Japan.  Sayo-chan must embark on a quest to save the gods of fortune and rid the countryside of these wicked youkai.

This game is a precursor to the "Pocky and Rocky" video game series.
