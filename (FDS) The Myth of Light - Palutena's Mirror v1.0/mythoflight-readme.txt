For those unaware, this game was localized in English under the name "Kid Icarus".

This game's story takes place in Angel Land, a fantasy land based on Greek Mythology.  Its ruler, Palutena, brought light and peace to the people of Angel Land, but the underworld's ruler, Meduda, wants to bring darkness and disorder.  Medusa stages a coup and imprisons Palutena and turns her soldiers to stone.  With what little magic Palutena has, she sends a bow and arrow to Pit, a prisoner in the underworld, who would use the arms to break free from the underworld and fight Medusa's forces and save Palutena.
