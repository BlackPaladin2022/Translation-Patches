**********************************

Eggerland: Souzou e no Tabidachi is a puzzle game in the Eggerland game series, developed and published by HAL Laboratory and released for the Famicom Disk System.  What set this game apart from the rest of the Eggerland games is the option to create your own puzzles for other players to play and solve.  (One could say this could be called "Eggerland Maker".)

While most of the Eggerland video game series was localized in English as "Adventures of Lolo", this game was never released outside of Japan.
