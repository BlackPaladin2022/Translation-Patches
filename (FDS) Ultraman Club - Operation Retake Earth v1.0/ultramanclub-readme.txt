----------------------------------------
-Ultraman Club: Chikkyuu Dakkan Sakusen-
----------------------------------------

Ultraman Club is an RPG, and it's the first of the Ultraman Club games.  Ultraman Club consists of several Ultraman characters, all of whom are brothers.  In this game, you play as Ultraman, and you must rescue your Ultra Brothers from five different regions.  (Mountain, Forest, Refinery, Glacier and City)  After all five regions are cleared, a sixth region is unlocked (Underground) where you confront the final boss of the game.

The following Ultra Brothers are featured in this game.

1966 Ultraman
1967 Ultra Seven
1971 Ultraman Jack (Return of Ultraman)
1972 Ultraman Ace
1973 Ultraman Taro
1974 Ultraman Leo

Note:  While you can clear all five stages in any order, the "City" stage must be played last.  Otherwise, the only way you can exit the City stage is to save at your headquarters.

Note II:  This game has a very annoying bug.  If you rescue Ultraman Taro and then travel to the Glacier stage, Ultraman Taro's Ultra Freezer will do no damage and won't freeze enemy kaiju in place.  Ultraman Taro's Ultra Freezer will work normally in other stage.  This bug occurs even in the original (Rev 1) FDS ROM.
