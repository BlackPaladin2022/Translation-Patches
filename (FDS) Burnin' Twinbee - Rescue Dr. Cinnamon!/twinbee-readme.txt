*****************************************

Moero Twinbee: Cinabon Hakase wo Sukue was the second game in Konami's Twinbee game series and an early entry into the cute-em-up video game genre.  While this game was released on the Famicom all the way back in 1993, the Famicom Disk System version of the game was released earlier in 1986.

This game was also released internationally under the name "Stinger" for the NES.

These patches are made for the Famicom Disk System version of the game, not the Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game.

As for any difference between the NES and FDS versions... 

1.  Moeru Twinbee allows up to three players to play simultaneously.  Stinger only allowed two players to play at once.
2.  Moeru Twinbee shows the opening and ending screens of the three grandchildren of Dr. Cinammon.  Stinger omitted this.
3.  Moeru Twinbee (FDS version) doesn't have a difficulty setting.  Stinger has two: Normal and Easy.
