This is a quick translation patch I made for the infamous game, "Koneko Monogatari: The Adventures of Chatran" for the Famicom Disk System.  For those who are unaware, this was based on the movie of the same name, which was later localized in English as "The Adventures of Milo and Otis".

No kittens or puppies were killed in the production of these patches.

The patch comes in four flavors;
The Adventures of Milo and Otis (English).ips
--English translation patch which changes the title screen to the localized movie title (IPS format)
The Adventures of Milo and Otis (English).bps
--English translation patch which changes the title screen to the localized movie title (BPS format)
A Kitten's Tale - The Adventures of Chatran (English).ips
--English translaiton patch which changes thte title screen to its transliterated movie title (IPS format)
A Kitten's Tale - The Adventures of Chatran (English).bps
--English translaiton patch which changes thte title screen to its transliterated movie title (IPS format)

All patches will correct the ending line from "HAPPY WE ARE." to "WE ARE HAPPY."
