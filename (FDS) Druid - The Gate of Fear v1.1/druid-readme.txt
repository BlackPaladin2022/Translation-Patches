-BlackPaladins's Druid: The Gate of Fear FDS Patch v1.0-
--------------------------------------------------------

*************************
*Druid: Kyoufu no Tobira*
*************************

I was bored and came across this old Action RPG called "Druid: Kyoufu no Tobira."  Originally, this game was made by Electrobyte Software and published by Firebird Software.  While this game was ported to several systems, this game was released in Japan on the Famicom Disk System in 1988 as "Druid: Kyoufu no Tobira".

You play the role of Hasrinaxx, a druid who must fight the dark mage, Acamantor, and his army of demons.

One thing I should mention, if you're playing without any cheat codes, you MUST pick up the key on the first chest you come across or you'll never be able to go past the second level.

The patch comes in two flavors:

Druid - The Gate of Fear v1.1 (English).ips (English patch in IPS Format; apply to JPN ROM)
Druid - The Gate of Fear v1.1 (English).bps (English patch in BPS Format; apply to JPN ROM)

I suggest using Lunar IPS for the patch.  Use either patch, according to your personal preference.

Be sure to use either IPS or BPS patch on the FDS ROM with the following hashes.  (Don't use both patches.)
