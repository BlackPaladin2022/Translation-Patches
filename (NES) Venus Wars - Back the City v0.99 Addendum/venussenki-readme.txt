-BlackPaladin's Venus Senki Addendum Patch-
-------------------------------------------

****************************
*Venus Wars - Back the City*
****************************

I was looking around RHDN one day and saw J2E's patch for Venus Senki which was marked "incomplete".  Well, I was bored and wanted to finish what was started and try to fix any errors left by the original team.


Patching Instructions:

This addendum patch comes in four flavors...

Venus Wars - Back the City (addendum).ips
--This patch requires a prepatched ROm that already have J2E's patch applied (IPS format)
Venus Wars - Back the City (addendum).bps
--This patch requires a prepatched ROm that already have J2E's patch applied (BPS format)
Venus Wars - Back the City (full patch).ips
--This patch requires and clean an unaltered Venus Senki ROM (IPS format)
Venus Wars - Back the City (full patch).ips
--This patch requires and clean an unaltered Venus Senki ROM (BPS format)

I recommend using Lunar IPS to apply the IPS patches.  Flips can be used to apply either IPS or BPS patches.

If your rom has NOT been altered, use either the IPS or BPS (not both) to the ROM with the following hashes...

File SHA-1: 30D2AB4AAAD05C2202B1AD89ABF93F4871B3FE21
File CRC32: E1123CA2
ROM SHA-1: 3954B966C85FEE05E15DB443F00B7816D565BF21
ROM CRC32: 1D8BF724

If your rom has J2E's translation patch already applied, use either IPS or BPS (not both) to the ROM with the following hashes...

File SHA-1: 57A70F9868956697A7D182AB14403B089511CFD5
File CRC32: E44BCAF4
ROM SHA-1: 68F0911CBFB8AA1E30D349CEF6DEC7C327454697
ROM CRC32: 89F8EBDA
